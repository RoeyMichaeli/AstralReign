## General Overview

**1. Introduction**
**"AstralReign"** is conceptualized as a grand strategy space empire simulator that intricately combines deep economic simulation, tactical space combat, and emergent storytelling within a modular gameplay framework. Players will navigate the complexities of managing an interstellar empire in a dynamic galaxy where factions, economies, and militaries interact in real time.

**2. Core Vision & Scope**
A **Living, Breathing Galaxy**: The game simulates an entire galaxy as a dynamic, evolving system, where every star system, planet, ship, and population group is interconnected and reacts to player actions.

**3. Gameplay Mechanics**
Gameplay revolves around several key modules, including economic management, tactical combat, diplomacy, and more. See the **Systems** section for details.

**4. Technical Architecture & System Design**
The game employs a modular architecture that allows different systems (e.g., economic, military, diplomatic) to operate independently while interacting through a shared data layer. This design enhances flexibility and scalability, enabling future updates and expansions without disrupting existing functionalities.

The upper layers of the Architecture are built with OOP principles in mind, while performance-heavy sections, such as the economy simulation system, celestial simulation, geopolitical cost-balance analysis, physics, etc. are built with DOD principles in mind.

**5. User Experience & Interface Design**
The user interface is focused on clarity and simplicity (Concise text and recognizable and easily differentiated icons), consistency (uniform fonts, colors, styles), feedback (less than 33ms between updates - in 30 fps scenarios, zero frames between updates). Visual hierarchy (Most critical information under one button click), Data Visualization (charts, graphs, dashboards), Minimize Cognitive Load (Essential data shown, with drill-down options)

**6. Audio Design & Music System**
The audio design philosophy focuses on creating dynamic soundscapes and adaptive music that respond to various gameplay states.

**7. Social Features & Community Integration**
The game may support modding in the future to foster community engagement and content creation.

4. **Geopolitics**: Oversees the balance of power between factions, territorial borders, and global political dynamics, ensuring shifting alliances and rivalries.
    
5. **Espionage**: Facilitates covert operations, intelligence gathering, sabotage, and counterintelligence, influencing faction behavior and strategic planning.
    
6. **Environmental**: Models planetary ecosystems, space conditions, and resource availability, impacting colonization, settlement, and resource extraction.
    
7. **Demography**: Tracks population growth, migration, and societal trends, influencing workforce availability, public sentiment, and economic stability.
    
8. **Sociology**: Simulates cultural development, public opinion, and social movements, affecting internal governance and inter-faction relations.
    
9. **Research**: Drives technological advancements, unlocking new capabilities for the playerâ€™s empire, including military tech, economic improvements, and social development.
    
10. **Ship Control (Tactical Combat)**: Allows players to control individual ships in real-time tactical combat, focusing on ship maneuvering, formations, and combat strategies.
